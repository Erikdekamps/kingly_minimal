# Kingly Minimal Theme

A minimal, modern Drupal 11 base theme with a Vite-powered, Single Directory
Component (SDC) architecture. It is designed for high performance,
maintainability, and accessibility.

## Features

* **Modern Frontend Stack:** Built with SCSS, CSS Custom Properties, and ES6+
  JavaScript.
* **Vite Integration:** Lightning-fast development server with Hot Module
  Replacement (HMR) and optimized production builds.
* **Single Directory Components (SDC):** A fully component-based architecture
  for maximum encapsulation, reusability, and maintainability. Component
  assets (`.twig`, `.yml`, `.scss`, `.js`) are co-located.
* **Theme Variations:** A robust system for creating and selecting alternative
  color schemes for the entire site, configurable through the theme settings UI.
* **WCAG AAA-Ready:** Enhanced with a high-contrast color palette, proper focus
  management, and semantic markup to meet or exceed accessibility standards.
* **Responsive and Mobile-First:** Designed to work beautifully on all devices
  using modern CSS Grid layouts.
* **Light/Dark Mode Toggle:** Includes a theme-toggle component for
  user-preferred color schemes, with a FOUC-prevention script.
* **Clean Twig Templates:** Core and module template overrides are minimal,
  acting as bridges to pass data to SDCs.

## Theme Variations

This theme includes a powerful system that allows for multiple, selectable
visual themes, called "variations." Each variation can provide a completely
different color palette and feel for the site while sharing the same underlying
layout and components.

### For Site Builders: Selecting a Theme

You can switch between available theme variations easily through the Drupal
admin UI.

1. Navigate to the theme settings page at **Appearance > Settings > Kingly
   Minimal** (or go directly to `/admin/appearance/settings/kingly_minimal`).
2. Find the **Theme Variation** select list.
3. Choose your desired theme (e.g., "Default Minimal", "Ocean").
4. Click **Save configuration**.

The selected theme will be applied globally across the site.

### For Developers: Creating a New Theme Variation

The theme variation system is designed to be easily extensible. All variations
are powered by CSS Custom Properties, making new themes a matter of defining a
new color palette, not rewriting component styles.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to creating a new "Forest" theme.

**Step 1: Create the SCSS Partial**

Create a new SCSS partial file inside the `scss/themes/` directory. The file
name should be prefixed with an underscore.

* **File:** `scss/themes/_forest.scss`

In this file, all styles must be wrapped in a class that matches the machine
name you will register in Step 3 (e.g., `.theme-forest`).

```scss
// scss/themes/_forest.scss
.theme-forest {
  // All theme variables will go here.
}
```

**Step 2: Define the Theme Palette and Mappings**

Our architecture uses a tiered system for CSS variables. This ensures
maintainability and makes it easy to create new themes and dark mode variants.

* **Tier 1: The Palette:** Define a set of CSS variables for your theme's unique
  color palette. This is the single source of truth for all colors in the "
  Forest" theme. Define palettes for both light and dark modes.
* **Tier 2: Global Mapping:** Map the theme's global semantic variables (
  e.g., `--color-text`, `--color-primary`) to your new palette.
* **Tier 3: Component Mapping:** Override specific component variables. This
  allows for fine-grained control over individual components if the global
  mapping isn't sufficient.

Here is an example for `_forest.scss`:

```scss
// scss/themes/_forest.scss
.theme-forest {

  // --- TIER 1: FOREST THEME PALETTE ---
  // Light Mode
  --forest-primary: #2a6f2a;
  --forest-primary-hover: #1e511e;
  --forest-background: #fdfdfa;
  --forest-text: #2c2921;
  --forest-border: rgb(42 111 42 / 0.3);
  // ...and so on for all required colors.

  // --- TIER 2: GLOBAL VARIABLE MAPPING ---
  --color-text: var(--forest-text);
  --color-background: var(--forest-background);
  --color-primary: var(--forest-primary);
  --color-primary-hover: var(--forest-primary-hover);
  --color-border: var(--forest-border);
  // ...etc.

  // --- TIER 3: COMPONENT VARIABLE MAPPING ---
  [data-component-id='kingly_minimal:card'] {
    --card-bg-color: var(--forest-background);
    --card-border-color: var(--forest-border);
  }

  // ...etc.

  // --- DARK MODE OVERRIDES ---
  // We only need to redefine the Tier 1 palette; all mappings will inherit the new values.
  html[data-theme="dark"] & {
    --forest-primary: #6ab06a;
    --forest-primary-hover: #83c183;
    --forest-background: #2a2823;
    --forest-text: #f0f0e8;
    // ...etc.
  }
}
```

**Step 3: Import the New Theme**

Open the main theme entry point and import your new partial.

* **File:** `scss/theme.scss`

```scss
// ... existing theme imports
@use 'themes/ocean';

// Add your new theme
@use 'themes/forest';
```

**Step 4: Register the Theme in the UI**

To make your new theme selectable in the UI, you need to add it to the theme
settings form.

* **File:** `theme-settings.php`

In the `kingly_minimal_form_system_theme_settings_alter` function, add your new
theme to the `#options` array. The key should match the class name you created
in Step 1.

```php
// ...
'#options' => [
  'theme-default' => t('Default Minimal'),
  'theme-ocean' => t('Ocean'),
  // Add your new theme here:
  'theme-forest' => t('Forest'),
],
// ...
```

**Step 5: Compile and Test**

Run the Vite build process to compile your new SCSS file into the
global `theme.css` stylesheet.

```bash
# For development
npm run dev

# For production
npm run build
```

Now, clear the Drupal cache (`drush cr`) and navigate to the theme settings
page. Your "Forest" theme should be available in the dropdown.

## Frontend Development Guidelines

This theme follows a strict "Single Source of Truth" philosophy for all
design-related values. The goal is to create a highly maintainable and
consistent codebase by eliminating "magic numbers" and repeated declarations.

**The Core Principle:** Before adding any static value (
e.g., `font-weight: 600`, `min-height: 44px`, `transition-duration: 0.15s`) to a
component's stylesheet, you **must** first check if a suitable design token
already exists in `scss/base/_variables.scss`.

**How to Apply This:**

1. **Consult `_variables.scss`:** This file is the theme's design system
   dictionary. It contains a comprehensive and well-organized set of design
   tokens, including:

* **Colors:** The full application color palette, including feedback and border
  colors.
* **Typography:** Font families, a full `h1`-`h6` responsive font size scale,
  line heights, and font weights.
* **Sizing:** A scale for element sizes, including the minimum accessible target
  size (`--size-target-min`), avatars, and icons.
* **Spacing:** A standard `xs` to `xl` spacing scale for margins, padding, and
  gaps.
* **Borders & Focus:** Variables for border widths, radii, and a globally
  consistent focus ring.
* **Transitions:** A scale for animation durations and timing functions.
* **Layout:** Tokens for container widths and grid properties.
* **Z-Index:** A managed scale for stacking contexts.

2. **Use Existing Variables:** Always prefer using an existing variable over a
   hardcoded value.

* **Good:** `font-weight: var(--font-weight-semibold);`
* **Bad:** `font-weight: 600;`

3. **Add New Variables When Necessary:** If you need a value that is not already
   defined but is likely to be reused, add it as a new variable to the
   appropriate category in `_variables.scss`.
4. **Scope Appropriately:** Global design tokens belong in `:root`. Dark mode
   overrides go in `html[data-theme="dark"]`.

By adhering to this principle, we ensure that the theme remains easy to update,
scale, and re-brand. A change to a single variable in `_variables.scss` will
correctly propagate throughout the entire component library.

## Installation & Usage

1. **Place the Theme:**
   Place the `kingly_minimal` theme in your project's `/web/themes/custom`
   directory.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to the theme directory and install the required Node.js packages.
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project/web/themes/custom/kingly_minimal
   npm install
   ```

3. **Development:**
   Run the Vite development server. This will watch for changes in your SCSS and
   JS files and provide live reloading.
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Production Build:**
   When you are ready to deploy, run the build script. This will compile,
   minify, and optimize all assets for production.
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Theme Architecture

* **/components:** This is the heart of the theme. Each subdirectory is a Single
  Directory Component containing its own Twig, YAML, SCSS, and JS files. The
  Vite build process automatically compiles assets into their respective
  component directories.
* **/scss:** Contains global SCSS files, including variables, mixins, resets,
  and base layout styles. These are compiled to the `/dist` directory.
  * **/scss/themes:** Contains the SCSS partials for each available theme
    variation.
* **/dist:** The output directory for compiled global CSS assets. **This
  directory is automatically generated.**
* **/templates:** Contains Drupal theme hook template overrides (
  e.g., `page.html.twig`, `node.html.twig`). These templates are kept lean and
  primarily serve to include SDCs.

## Regions

The theme provides the following regions for block placement, including a
granular "brick" layout for the footer:

* `page_top`: Page top
* `branding`: Branding
* `main_navigation`: Main navigation
* `breadcrumbs`: Breadcrumbs
* `page_title`: Page title
* `system_messages`: System messages
* `tabs`: Tabs
* `content_top`: Content top
* `content`: Content
* `content_bottom`: Content bottom
* `footer_top_left`: Footer Top Left
* `footer_top_right`: Footer Top Right
* `footer_first`: Footer Column 1
* `footer_second`: Footer Column 2
* `footer_third`: Footer Column 3
* `footer_fourth`: Footer Column 4
* `footer_bottom_left`: Footer Bottom Left
* `footer_bottom_right`: Footer Bottom Right
* `hidden`: Hidden

## Accessibility Compliance (WCAG)

This theme has been enhanced to meet or exceed several WCAG success criteria.

- [x] **1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced) - AAA:** The theme's color palette has been
  audited and adjusted. Both light and dark modes ensure all default text has
  a contrast ratio of at least 7:1 against its background.
- [x] **2.4.9 Link Purpose (Link Only) - AAA:** Components
  like `footer-link-list` accept an optional `aria_label` to provide a clear,
  distinct accessible name for links that might otherwise be ambiguous.
- [x] **2.5.5 Target Size (Enhanced) - AAA:** All interactive elements (links,
  buttons, icons) are designed to have a minimum target size of 44x44 CSS
  pixels.
- [x] **2.4.7 Focus Visible - AA / 2.4.13 Focus Appearance - AAA:** All
  interactive elements have a highly visible and consistent focus indicator.
- [x] **2.4.5 Multiple Ways - AA:** The theme provides both a primary
  navigation menu and breadcrumbs, offering users multiple ways to navigate the
  site.
- [x] **2.4.6 Headings and Labels - AA:** Semantic headings are used
  correctly. Form elements and navigation landmarks are programmatically
  associated with their labels (`aria_labelledby`).
- [x] **2.4.8 Location - AAA:** The active link in navigation
  menus (`main-menu`, `pager`, `local-tasks`) is programmatically identified
  using `aria-current="page"`.
- [x] **3.2.5 Change on Request - AAA:** Links that open in a new tab or
  window include a warning for all users, both visually (via `title` attribute)
  and for screen readers.
- [x] **3.2.3 Consistent Navigation - AA:** The main navigation and footer are
  presented consistently across all pages of the site.
- [x] **3.3.2 Labels or Instructions - A:** All form controls have associated
  labels. Navigation and other key regions have accessible names provided via
  `aria-label` or `aria_labelledby`.
- [x] **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value - A:** All UI components have the correct
  role (e.g., `button`, `navigation`, `alert`) and their state (e.g.,
  `aria-pressed`, `aria-current`) is programmatically determinable.

## Componentization Roadmap

The following theme hook templates have been identified as candidates for
conversion to Single Directory Components. This roadmap outlines the path to
achieving 100% component-based rendering.

- [x] **`field.html.twig`**: A generic `field` SDC has been created to handle
  the wrapper and label logic. This standardizes the display of all
  fields that don't have a specific override.
- [x] **`views-view.html.twig`**: A `views-view` SDC has been created to
  abstract the complex structure of a view (header, footer, rows, pager). This
  makes styling different view displays more consistent.
- [ ] **`region.html.twig`**: While simple, creating a `region` SDC could be
  useful if regions ever required more complex logic or specific styling hooks
  beyond what a class provides.
- [ ] **`node-edit-form.html.twig`**: The two-column layout for the node edit
  form could be encapsulated in a `node-form-layout` SDC. This would allow for
  easy reuse of this layout for other entity forms.
- [ ] **`maintenance-page.html.twig`**: The maintenance page could be its
  own `maintenance-page` SDC, simplifying the template file and making its
  styling self-contained.
- [ ] **`block.html.twig`**: The default block template could be converted
  into a `block` SDC. This would be a low-priority conversion, as many blocks
  already have specific SDC bridges (e.g.,
  `block--system-menu-block--main.html.twig`), but it would complete the
  component coverage.
