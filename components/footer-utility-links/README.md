# Footer: Utility Links

Renders a list of utility links for the footer bottom bar, such as a contact
link, and optionally includes the theme toggle button.

## Features

- **Composable:** Includes the `kingly_minimal:theme-toggle` component.
- **Configurable:** The list of links is passed in as a prop, and the visibility
  of the theme toggle is controlled by a boolean prop.

## WCAG Compliance

- **2.5.5 Target Size (Enhanced) (AAA):** The links are styled with a minimum
  height to ensure they meet the 44x44 CSS pixel target size.
- **3.2.4 Consistent Identification (AA):** Provides a consistent set of utility
  links in the footer across all pages.
