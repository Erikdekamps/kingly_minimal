// This component is intentionally unstyled.
// It is a low-level utility component that should inherit its visual
// appearance from the context in which it is placed.
//
// For example, if placed inside `.prose`, it will inherit the link styles
// from the `text` component. If placed inside a `footer-link-list`, it will
// adopt the styles defined in that component's SCSS file.

[data-component-id='kingly_minimal:link'] {
  // No styles by default.
