# Quote

Renders a `<blockquote>` with an optional attribution. Ideal for testimonials or
highlighting text.

## Features

- **Semantic:** Uses the correct `<blockquote`> and `<footer>` elements for
  quotes and their attribution, which is semantically correct and accessible.
- **Content-Driven:** Accepts the quote text and attribution as props, making it
  easy to populate from a paragraph or other content entity.

## WCAG Compliance

- **1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A):** The use of `<blockquote>` and `<footer>`
  programmatically identifies the content as a quote and properly associates the
  attribution with it.
