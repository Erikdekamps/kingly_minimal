# Section

A generic container component, typically used to wrap the output of a Layout
Paragraphs field.

## Usage

This component's primary purpose is to provide a consistent DOM
element (`<div class="kingly-section">`) around the complex markup generated by
Layout Paragraphs. It is intentionally unstyled, as all visual styling (padding,
backgrounds, etc.) is expected to be handled by the layout plugin's render
array, which is placed inside this component's `content` slot.

It acts as a clean bridge between the paragraph entity and the layout system.
