# Defines the primary global styles for the theme.
# This library includes the foundational CSS (variables, resets), main page
# layout, and generic content styles that apply globally.
# Component-specific styles are loaded automatically by the SDC module, so
# their libraries are no longer defined here.

# Note: All other components like buttons, breadcrumbs, menus, etc., are now
# Single Directory Components. The SDC module automatically discovers and
# attaches their CSS and JS assets, so they do not need to be defined here.
