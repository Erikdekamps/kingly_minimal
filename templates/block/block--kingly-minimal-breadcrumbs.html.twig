/**
 * @file
 * Theme override for the breadcrumbs block.
 *
 * This template removes the default block wrapper (`<div class="block">...</div>`).
 * The breadcrumbs component is now self-contained and provides its own wrapper
 * element, so the default block markup is unnecessary. This results in a
 * cleaner, more semantic DOM and allows the full-bleed styling to work
 * correctly.
 *
 * The `content` variable contains the output from the `breadcrumb.html.twig`
 * template, which in turn includes our 'breadcrumbs' Single Directory Component.
