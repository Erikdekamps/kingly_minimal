 * Theme override for a breadcrumb trail.
 *
 * This template acts as a bridge to the 'breadcrumbs' Single Directory Component.
 * It passes the `breadcrumb` links array and the current page `title` to the
 * component's props. It uses `drupal_title()` from Twig Tweak to reliably get
 * the title as a render array.
 *
 * It also prevents rendering the breadcrumb on the front page.
