 * Theme override for the Card paragraph type.
 *
 * This template acts as a bridge, mapping the paragraph's rendered content
 * into the 'content' slot of the 'kingly_sdc:card' Single Directory Component.
 * The SDC provides the main wrapper and styling, while Drupal's view mode
 * configuration handles the inner field layout (horizontal vs. vertical).
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - paragraph: The paragraph entity.
 * - content: All paragraph items. Preprocessed.
 * - attributes: HTML attributes for the wrapper.
 * - All DDC variables are available.

    {#
    The entire rendered content of the paragraph, as configured in the
    view display (e.g., card_horizontal, card_vertical), is passed into
    the component's content slot. This maintains the separation of concerns:
    Drupal manages the content structure, and the SDC provides the styling wrapper.
